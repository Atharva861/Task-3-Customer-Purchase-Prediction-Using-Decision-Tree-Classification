# Task-3-Customer-Purchase-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree-Classification
In this task, a decision tree classifier was implemented to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral attributes. The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was utilized. Categorical variables were encoded, and the data was split into training and testing sets. The model was then trained and evaluated to understand its predictive performance.

## *What is a Decision Tree Classifier?*
A Decision Tree Classifier is a machine learning algorithm used to predict outcomes by learning simple rules from the data.

### How Does It Work? (Simple Terms)
1. The data is split into groups based on the features (like Age, Sex, Pclass, etc.).

2. At each step, the algorithm asks a "yes" or "no" question about one of the features.

   _Example: Is the user female?_

4. Based on the answer, the data is divided into smaller and smaller groups.

5. This continues until the algorithm can make a prediction â€” like whether the passenger survived or not.

6. The final model looks like a tree with branches, where each leaf gives a prediction.
